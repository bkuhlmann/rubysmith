Rubysmith is a command line interface for smithing Ruby projects.

This gem is useful in situations in which you need something more sophisticated than a
link:https://bundler.io/guides/bundler_in_a_single_file_ruby_script.html[Bundler Inline] script but
less complicated than a Ruby Gem as provided by
link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/gemsmith[Gemsmith].

=== Building

The core functionality of this gem centers around the `--build` command with optional customization
provided via build options. By default, all build options are enabled. Example:

[source,bash]
----
rubysmith --build demo
----

Running the above will generate a new `demo` Ruby project with all options enabled. Should you wish
to disable specific options, you can use the `--no-*` prefix. Example:

[source,bash]
----
rubysmith --build demo --no-pry --no-guard
----

With the above example, both Pry and Guard support would have been disabled when building the `demo`
project. Taking this a step further, you can also use the `--min` option to generate a project with
bare minimum of options. Example:

[source,bash]
----
rubysmith --build demo --min
----

The above is essentially the same as building with _all_ options disabled. This is handy in
situations where you need to quickly script something up for sharing with others yet still want to
avoid using a Bundler Inline script so gem dependencies are not installed each time the code is run.

To have specific options enabled/disabled _every time_ you build a new Ruby project, you can edit
your global configuration for making these settings permanent (see below for details).

=== Configuration

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

....
$HOME/.config/rubysmith/configuration.yml
....

It can also be configured via link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment
variables.

The default configuration is as follows:

[source,yaml]
