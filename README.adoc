= Rubysmith

Rubysmith is a command line interface for smithing Ruby projects.

This gem is useful in situations in which you need something more sophisticated than a
{bundler_inline_link} script but less than a {gemsmith_link} gem. Rubysmith is the foundation of Gemsmith and provides much of the same functionality as Gemsmith but is solely tailored for pure Ruby projects. Again, this is a great tool for spiking quick Ruby implementations, sharing code snippets with others, or building full blown Ruby projects for collaboration with others.

==== Build

The core functionality of this gem centers around the `--build` command and associated options
(flags). The build options allow you to further customize the kind of project you want to build.
Most build options are enabled by default. Example:

[source,bash]
----
rubysmith build --name demo
----

Running the above will generate a new `demo` Ruby project. Should you wish to disable specific
options, you can use `--no-*` prefixes. Example:

[source,bash]
----
rubysmith build --name demo --no-debug --no-reek
----

With the above example, both Debug and Reek support would have been disabled when building the `demo` project. Taking this a step further, you can also use the `--min` option to generate a project with bare minimum of options. Example:

[source,bash]
----
rubysmith build --name demo --min
----

The above is the same as building with _all options disabled_. This is handy in situations where you need to quickly script something up for sharing with others yet still want to avoid using a {bundler_inline_link} script so gem dependencies are not installed each time the code is run.

As shown earlier, you can combine options but be aware that order matters. Take the following, for example, where both minimum and maximum options are used in conjunction with other options:

[source,bash]
----
rubysmith build --name demo --min --zeitwerk
rubysmith build --name demo --max --no-debug
----

With the above examples, the first line will _disable all options_ except Zeitwerk while the second line will _enable all options_ except Debug. This can be a handy way to build a new project with all options either disabled or enabled with only a few select options modified. To have specific options enabled/disabled _every time_, you can edit your global configuration for making these settings permanent (see below for details).

There is a lot of flexibility when building a new project through the various build options. I'll walk you through each so you can better understand why you'd want to enable or disable them.

===== Amazing Print

The `--amazing_print` option allows you to build your project with the
link:https://github.com/amazing-print/amazing_print[Amazing Print] gem for debugging purposes and is
a handy debugging tool when inspecting your Ruby objects and printing details in a quick to read
format.

===== Bootsnap

The `--bootsnap` option allows you to build your project with the
link:https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap[Bootsnap] gem for improved performance. This is best used for pure, non-gem, Ruby projects and/or web applications in general.

===== Caliber

The `--caliber` option allows you to build your project with the
link:https://alchemists.io/projects/caliber[Caliber] gem so you have an immediate working -- and
high quality -- link:https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop[RuboCop] configuration. Read the Caliber
documentation for further customization. This adds the following files when enabled:

....
├── bin
│  ├── rubocop
├── .config
│  └── rubocop
│     └── config.yml
....

===== Circle CI

The `--circle_ci` option allows you to build your project with link:https://circleci.com[Circle CI]
configured so you can get your project building as quickly as possible. This adds the following file when enabled:

....
├── .circleci
│  └── config.yml
....

===== Citation

The `--citation` option allows you to add a link:https://citation-file-format.github.io[citation]
file to your project so you can help the research community cite your work in their studies if your
project is used. This adds the following file when enabled:

....
├── CITATION.cff
....

===== Community

The `--community` option allows you to link to your open source community, organization, or group
chat to help with community engagement of your work. The link is added to the `README` file when enabled.

===== Code of Conduct

The `--conduct` option allows you to link to your link:https://www.contributor-covenant.org[Code of
Conduct] to encourage good community participation. Regardless of whether you have a community or
not, the code of conduct is good to encourage in general. The link is added to the `README` file when enabled.

===== Console

The `--console` option allows you to add a `console` script for local development. So instead of
typing `irb`, you can type `bin/console` and get an IRB session with all of your project's code
loaded. This adds the following file when enabled:

....
├── bin
│  ├── console
....

===== Contributions

The `--contributions` option allows you to link to contributing documentation so people know to
contribute back to your work. The link is added to the `README` file when enabled.

===== Developer Certificate of Origin

The `--dcoo` option allows to you add link:https://developercertificate.org[Developer Certificate of Origin] documentation so all contributors are aware of how their contributions are applied in terms of ownership, copyright, and licensing. The link is added to the `README` file when enabled.

===== Debug

The `--debug` option allows you add the link:https://github.com/ruby/debug[Debug] gem to your
project for debugging your code by setting breakpoints, remotely connecting to running code, and
much more.

===== Docker

The `--docker` option allows you add {docker_link} to your project so you can build and deploy a production image of your software. When enabled, these files will appear in your project:

....
├── bin
│  ├── docker
│  │  ├── build       # Use to build your production image for local use.
│  │  ├── console     # Use to interact with your production image.
│  │  └── entrypoint  # Conditionally enables jemalloc support.
├── .dockerignore     # Defines the files/folders Docker should ignore.
├── Dockerfile        # Defines how to build your production image.
....

===== Development Containers

The `--devcontainer` option allows you add {development_containers_link} support to your project so you can develop locally by running your project within a {docker_link} container. When enabled, these files will be added to your project:

....
├── .devcontainer
│  ├── compose.yaml       # Your Docker Compose configuration.
│  ├── devcontainer.json  # Your Developer Container configuration.
│  └── Dockerfile         # The steps for building your development environment.
....

ℹ️ The `Dockerfile` uses the {docker_alpine_ruby_link} base image so you have a small but functional image. This base image can be easily be swapped out with a base image you prefer.

===== Funding

The `--funding` option allows you add a link:https://github.com[GitHub] funding configuration to
your project so you can attract link:https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors[sponsors]. This option
doesn't require use of the `--git_hub` option but is encouraged. This adds the following file when enabled:

....
├── .github
│  ├── FUNDING.yml
....

===== Git

The `--git` option allows you add link:https://git-scm.com[Git] repository support. Includes link:https://alchemists.io/screencasts/git_safe[Git Safe] functionality so you don't have to prefix commands with the `bin/` path prefix. Instead, you can call the command directly (assuming you have configured your link:https://alchemists.io/projects/dotfiles[Dotfiles] accordingly).

===== GitHub

The `--git_hub` option allows you add link:https://github.com[GitHub] templates to your project for
issues and pull requests. This adds the following fhile when enabled:

....
├── .github
│  ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
│  └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
....

===== GitHub CI

The `--git_hub_ci` option allows you to build your project with link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions[GitHub Actions] configured so you can get your project building as quickly as possible. This adds the following file when enabled:

....
├── .github
│  ├── workflows
│  │  └── ci.yml
....

===== Git Lint

The `--git-lint` option allows you to add the link:https://alchemists.io/projects/git-lint[Git
Lint] gem to your project to ensure you are crafting your Git commits in a consistent and readable
manner.

===== IRB Kit

The `--irb-kit` option allows you add the link:https://alchemists.io/projects/irb-kit[IRB Kit] gem to your project for additional extensions you can use within IRB to improve your workflow.

===== License

The `--license` option ensures you build your project with a license.

===== Maximum

The `--max` option allows you to build your project with _all options enabled_. This is a quick way
to build a new project without having to pick and choose.

===== Minimum

The `--min` option allows you to build your project with _all options disabled_. This is a quick way to build a new project with the bare minimum of support which is a one step above reaching for a {bundler_inline_link} script.

===== Rake

The `--rake` option allows you to add the link:https://github.com/ruby/rake[Rake] gem for quickly
crafting build scripts. This adds the following files to your project:

....
├── bin
│  ├── rake
├── Rakefile
....

===== Readme

The `--readme` option allows you to add README documentation to your project.

===== Reek

The `--reek` option allows you add the link:https://github.com/troessner/reek[Reek] gem to your
project for code smell and code quality support. This adds the `.reek.yml` configuration to your project.

===== Refinements

The `--refinements` option allows you to add the
link:https://alchemists.io/projects/refinements[Refinements] gem to your project which enhances
Ruby core objects without monkey patching your code.

===== RSpec

The `--rspec` option allows you add the link:https://rspec.info[RSpec] gem to your project for
defining your project specifications and have a framework for testing your code. This adds the following files to your project:

....

├── spec
│  ├── lib
│  │  └── <your project name>_spec.rb
│  ├── support
│  │  └── shared_contexts
│  │     └── temp_dir.rb
│  └── spec_helper.rb
....

===== Repl Type Completor (RTC)

The `--rtc` option allows you add the link:https://github.com/ruby/repl_type_completor[Repl Type Completor] gem to your project for improved type completion when using link:https://github.com/ruby/irb[IRB].

===== Setup

The `--setup` option allows you to configure you project with automated setup instructions so anyone
new to your project can quickly get started by running the `bin/setup` script. This adds the following file to your project:

....
│  └── setup
....

===== SimpleCov

The `--simple_cov` option allows you add the
link:https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov[SimpleCov] gem to your project to provide full
analysis of your project's code quality and/or find code that is unused.

===== Versions

The `--versions` option allows you add a `VERSIONS` file to your project to provide details about
all published versions of your project.

===== Zeitwerk

The `--zeitwerk` option allows you add the link:https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk[Zeitwerk] gem to your project so you can reduce the maintenance burden of managing requirements when adding new objects to your project.

This includes having access to your project's Zeitwerk loader for inspection and debugging purposes. This means if you built a `Demo` project, you'd immediately have access to your project's loader via `Demo.loader` when using the project console (i.e. `bin/console`, assuming you built your project with the `--console` flag enabled which is default behavior).

=== Configuration

By customizing your configuration, you can change Rubysmith's default behavior when building projects. This is a great way to define your own specialized settings other than what is provided by default. This is also a handy way to provide additional information needed for some of the build options.

You'll also notice some of the values use {string_formats_link} which means you can use any fully qualified key as a string specifier for supported keys like those found in the `author` and `project` sections.

Each section of the configuration is explained below.

==== Author

Author information is used when generating project documentation and is recommended you fill this
information in before building a project. Example:

[source,yaml]
----
author:
  email: jsmith@example.com
  family_name: Smith
  given_name: Jill
  author_uri:  # Requires being supplied.
----

If your global link:https://git-scm.com[Git] configuration is properly configured, your given name;
family name; and email will be used by default. Should you not want to defer to Git, you can supply
custom values as desired. The URI is the only value that can't be automatically computed for you.

==== Build

All build options only accept booleans values and can be customized as desired. When changing your build options, they will dynamically render when displaying usage (i.e. `rubysmith --help`). All of these options have been explained in greater detail in the _Usage_ section.

ℹ️ The `cli` option is provided to support {gemsmith_link} but is not, currently, used by
this project.

==== Citations

This section allows you to configure your link:https://orcid.org[ORCID]
link:https://citation-file-format.github.io[citation] information used by the research community.
[source,yaml]
----
citation:
  affiliation:  # Defaults to organization label (see above).
  message:      # Defaults to supplied message (see above).
  orcid:        # Defaults to https://orcid.org/ when no ID is supplied.
----

Your author, project, and license information will be used when building this file.

==== Documentation

Use this section to define the kind of documentation you want generated for your project. The
following options are available:

* `adoc`: Uses link:https://asciidoctor.org[ASCII Doc] format.
* `md`: Uses link:https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown[Markdown] format.

==== License

Use this section to define the license you want to use for your project. When picking a license, you can supply the appropriate `label` and `version` in addition to the `name`. The `name` is the only value you _can't_ customize. The following details all supported licenses.

===== Apache

To use the link:https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache] license, apply this configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
license:
  label: "Apache"
  name: "apache"
  version: "2.0"
----

===== Fair Source

To use the link:https://fsl.software[Fair Source] license, apply this configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
license:
  label: "Fair Source"
  name: "fair"
  version: "FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0"
----

===== Hippocratic

To use the link:https://firstdonoharm.dev[Hippocratic] license, apply this configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
license:
  label: "Hippocratic"
  name: "hippocratic"
  version: "2.1"
----

ℹ️ This is the default license unless you customize.

===== MIT

To use the  link:https://mit-license.org[MIT] license, apply this configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
license:
  label: "MIT"
  name: "mit"
  version: ""
----

==== Organization

Use this section to define organization specific information. This is useful for information that isn't project specific but related to all projects within your organization. You'll want -- highly recommended -- to supply configuration details. For example, here's what a fictional organization might look like:

[source,yaml]
----
organization:
  label: ACME
  uri: https://acme.io
----

==== Project

There are two sub-categories within this section: URIs and version. The URIs allow you to link to
specific documentation related to your project. You'll want to customize these URIs since they are
used for documentation, citations, and general project information. Some of the URIs are also used
by the {gemsmith_link} gem.

One powerful feature of this configuration is that you can use `%<project_name>s` as a placeholder _anywhere_ in your URIs and Rubysmith will ensure your place holder is replaced with your project name when generating a new project. Example:

....
# Configuration
https://www.example.com/%<project_name>s

# Command
rubysmith build --name demo

# Actual (computed result)
https://www.example.com/demo
....

As for the `version` key, this defines the default version of newly created projects. `0.0.0` is the default but you can use a higher version number like `0.1.0` or even `1.0.0` if you are super confident in your work. That said, a lower the number is recommended when building your initial project which is why `0.0.0` is the default.

==== Repository

Your repository handle is the handle you setup when creating your account (i.e. `+https://github.com/<your_handle>+`). This information is used for template, funding, and/or URI construction purposes. These are the defaults but you'll want to customize to reflect the service you are using:

``` yaml
repository:
  handle: undefined
  uri: https://github.com
```

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/rubysmith
cd rubysmith
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/rake
